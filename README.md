# Welcome!

This is a rewrite of the Jekyll Kraedt website, using React. The original plan was to rewrite the entire backend and clean things up, moving more functionality to the server-side to make things easier to update when I release new music.
However, I've mostly decided to get rid of the backend entirely and find an alternative method of hosting song files and data. Work in progress!

Feel free to read through the code, but you won't find any hidden releases or secret download links here :)

P.S: Note to self, to deploy the site to GH Pages run `npm run deploy`
