~~* need to figure out cors issues (maybe not an issue if i can get the damn thing to publish)~~
~~* need to set up ftp server so i can start uploading mp3 files and stuff~~

current todos:
* delete everything twitter-related
* finish updating hard-coded data (songs, albums, spotlight)
* upload all song files and set download urls (can my site do a direct download without opening a new tab?)
* ensure everything is working, remove welcome message, then I can deploy finally

later todos (improvements):
* move hard-coded data to json file on drive, fetch data
* maybe make some style improvements / css refactoring
* continue implementing alternate website roots (for sbb, etc.)
