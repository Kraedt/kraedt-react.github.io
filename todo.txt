current todos:
* maybe make some style improvements / css refactoring
* continue implementing alternate website roots (for sbb, etc.)

other todos:
* refactor duplicate header, homepage, footer, contact, 404 (although styling might be a challenge?)
* deprecate / remove support for loading images from google drive (it's way too slow)
