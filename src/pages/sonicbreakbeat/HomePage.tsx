            Sonic Breakbeat is an ex-brony musician from Wisconsin, USA who produces Progressive House, Drum n' Bass and other genres of Electronic Dance Music.
            His previous works include remixes of other brony musicians, original music using vocal clips from My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic and original music that is instrumental.

            With a revival of the alias, Sonic Breakbeat's newer works feature a mix of familiar and newer styles, combined with higher production quality and themes detached from MLP:FiM.

            His name "Sonic Breakbeat" is portmanteau of "Sonic Rainboom", an stunt that Rainbow Dash from My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic is able to pull, and "Breakbeat", a word describing a broken drum break within songs of Jungle or Drum n' Bass genre, but more widely known as a musical genre.
