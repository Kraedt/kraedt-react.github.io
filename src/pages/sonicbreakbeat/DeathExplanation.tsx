      <h2>So, what happened to Sonic Breakbeat? Why was the original YouTube channel deleted?</h2>
      <p>
        There are two reasons why I decided to delete the YouTube channel and cease music production as Sonic Breakbeat:
      </p>
      <p>
        One, I had started a new alias (Kraedt) with the goal of becoming a full-time music producer and operating professionally - I didn't want my past music to hinder progress, both because of it being low quality and MLP-related.
        Becoming a full-time producer didn't exactly work out, and I'm thankful to have a fulfilling career / "day job" that provides me with enough time and money to continue music production as a hobby.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two, I had foolishly signed the YouTube channel to a YouTube network. I didn't read the fine print saying that I was bound to it for 5 years, and that they could potentially claim any content on other channels I managed (including Kraedt).
        I panicked and did not want them to find out about my new channel, and decided to go the nuclear route and delete both the channel and all social media related to Sonic Breakbeat. Thankfully, I didn't hear anything from the network, so it seems to have worked.
        I felt like deleting the channel was okay, provided I left behind some kind of explanation (the twit-longer post, which retrospectively was vague and unhelpful), and a link to an archive with all of the music for download.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that I've decided to purely pursue music production as a hobby and don't think I'll be hearing from the YouTube network, I decided to reupload all of my previous work to a fresh channel, and provide the downloads here.
      </p>
      <h2>What does the future hold?</h2>
      <p>
        It's hard to say, really. I still have friends who are tied to the pony fandom, but I have no interest in the show whatsoever. I think I can safely say that there will be no future pony-related original music or remixes,
        but I may utilize this alias for remasters, reworks, or original tracks completely unrelated to MLP. I've already released a 'Hands Up' mix of Destiny, which you can find <Link to="/sonicbreakbeat/music/song/destiny-2023-hands-up-mix">here</Link>.
